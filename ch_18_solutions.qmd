## 18.3.4 Exercises:

1.  Whether a flight has the tail number recorded in planes is highly correlated with the carrier, with nearly all flights from MQ (Envoy Air) not having a tail number recorded. Interesting to note that Envoy Air is a subsidiary of AA, the other carrier with a high proportion of tail numbers missing.

    ```{r}
    tailnum_not_in_plane <- flights |> 
      distinct(tailnum) |> 
      anti_join(planes, by = 'tailnum') |> 
      pull()

    flights |> 
      group_by(carrier) |> 
      summarise(
        number_of_flights = n(),
        no_tail = sum(tailnum %in% tailnum_not_in_plane),
        perc_no_tail = round(no_tail / (number_of_flights) *100, 2)
      ) |> 
      arrange(desc(number_of_flights))
    ```
