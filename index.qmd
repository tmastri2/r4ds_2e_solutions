title: "r4ds 2e Solutions:"
---

While official solutions were published [here](https://mine-cetinkaya-rundel.github.io/r4ds-solutions/), there are chapters left blank and I thought I would share my own attempts. This was done as a personal project, and I would expect this to be less a source of truth than a guide for others who might also be self-studying this textbook.

If I have errors or my answer isn't sufficient, I noticed there are solutions posted elsewhere for the majority of the exercises included here.\
